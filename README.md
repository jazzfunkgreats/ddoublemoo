# ddoublemoo
Perl script to download a random rap bar from RapGenius and output it to cowsay.
Honestly, the lyric could be anything off of RapGenius from D Double E to Madonna, but if it's not lit then what's the point?

### Usage ###
Running the program `./ddoublemoo.pl` with no arguments will randomly spawn a D Double E lyric.
It's possible to enter an argument to search for any other rapper - for example, inputting `./ddoublemoo.pl "danny brown"` is going to pull some *real* sick bars.

### OS X Dependencies ###
Requires cowsay and wget, installable via brew - `brew install cowsay` and `brew install wget`.
